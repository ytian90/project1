I don't know what to type into the list. 
Lists, stacks and queues are linear data structures. A tree is a
nonlinear, two-dimensional data structure with special preperties. Tree
nodes contain two or more links. 
This section discusses binary trees - trees whose nodes need contain two
links. 
The root node is the first node in a tree. Each link in the root node
refers to a child. 
The left child is the first node in the left subtree, and the right
child is the first node in the right subtree.
The children of a specific node are called sibling. 
A node with no children is called a leaf node. Computer scientists
normally draw trees from the root node down - the opposite of the way
most trees grow in nature.
